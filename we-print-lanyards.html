		<h2>We Print Lanyards</h2>
		<h4>Photoshop • Illustrator • Quark • Procreate • Figma • InDesign • Active Reports</h4>
		<p>Jo is the the in-house designer for We Print Gifts. Their primary role is to create unique and fun stock artwork for
			the variety of products We Print Lanyards sell; lanyards and ID cards. This includes creating product descriptions, test
			printing, photography, and organising putting new products onto the system and on the website. Their day-to-day
			responsibilities are more broad as they are also part of the art-working team and work closely with marketing
			and IT.

			When art working, they create proofs for lanyards, ID cards, and name badges, some notable customers being Man
			City, the NHS, Radio 1. They create artwork with a combination of Photoshop, Illustrator, and Quark. Since
			joining the art working team they have found new ways of extracting logos and imagery at higher qualities, they
			have shared this knowledge with the other art worker and it has elevated the overall quality of artwork
			being produced. They have received many compliments from customers about being communicative and for going
			above and beyond to ensure that artwork is as perfect as it can be, if not they work with customers to give them
			realistic expectations for the final print.

			Working with marketing has further expanded the mediums and skillsets that they work with - they do more print
			work as well as digital work. Some of their print-based work includes creating business-card size promotional
			material, as well as creating a product catalogue which have boosted sales. They also make a majority of the
			digital graphics - web banners, web ads, and we have recently redesigned the email templates that get sent
			to customers on a daily basis. They saw the email template project through from beginning to end. They created
			mock ups and prototypes of the email templates using Figma and Visual Studio Code, created a progress system
			for me and IT to use and communicate on, directed design decisions when problems occurred, and testing. </p>
